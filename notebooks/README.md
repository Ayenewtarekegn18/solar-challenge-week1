# Solar Challenge Week 1 - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project analyzes solar potential across three West African countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The analysis includes data processing, statistical analysis, and interactive visualizations through a Streamlit dashboard.

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Project setup and environment configuration
- ✅ Data cleaning and individual country analysis
- ✅ Cross-country comparison analysis
- ✅ Interactive dashboard development (Streamlit)

## Key Findings
- **Benin** shows the highest mean GHI (236.23 W/m²)
- **Togo** exhibits the most stable solar conditions
- **Sierra Leone** has comparable DHI values despite lower overall potential
- Strong correlation between GHI and DNI across all countries
