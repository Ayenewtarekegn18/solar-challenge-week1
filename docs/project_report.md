# Solar Potential Analysis Dashboard - Project Documentation

## 1. Business Objective

The project aims to develop an interactive dashboard for analyzing solar radiation data across three West African countries (Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo) to:

- Identify regions with optimal solar potential
- Compare solar radiation patterns across countries
- Provide actionable insights for solar energy investment decisions
- Enable data-driven policy making for renewable energy development

## 2. Task Planning and Strategy

### 2.1 Project Roadmap

1. **Environment Setup (Week 1)**

   - [x] Git repository initialization
   - [x] Project structure creation
   - [x] Development environment configuration

2. **Data Analysis Phase (Week 1-2)**

   - [x] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Statistical summary generation
     - Distribution analysis
     - Correlation studies
   - [x] Data Cleaning
     - Missing value handling
     - Outlier detection using Z-score
     - Timestamp standardization
   - [x] Statistical Testing
     - ANOVA for GHI comparison
     - Correlation analysis
     - Seasonal trend analysis

3. **Dashboard Development (Week 2-3)**
   - [x] Core Features Implementation
     - Multi-country selection
     - Interactive visualizations
     - Real-time data updates
   - [ ] Advanced Features
     - Custom date range selection
     - Export functionality
     - Additional visualizations

### 2.2 Methodology Rationale

1. **Data Processing**

   - Z-score outlier detection: Chosen for its statistical robustness and ability to handle non-normal distributions
   - Median imputation: Selected over mean to handle skewed distributions in solar data
   - Timestamp standardization: Ensures consistent time-based analysis across countries

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - ANOVA: Appropriate for comparing means across multiple countries
   - Correlation analysis: Identifies relationships between different solar metrics
   - Time series decomposition: Reveals seasonal patterns and trends

## 3. Current Progress
